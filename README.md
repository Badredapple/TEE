TEE
=====
Trusted Execution Environment
------
  This repo is from a information security laboratory in BUPT.
  This is aims at find a new way to privode a secuity, fast, useful way in hands-on divers and IoT
  In another way ,I will try to attack those repos in order to make sure the secuity.
  
  I do not think there somethings too secuity to  Penetration testing
  any " safe applaction" is just "safe" sometimes , in the end ,unless the attacker is give up ,you could get safe.
